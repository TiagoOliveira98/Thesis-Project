# Thesis Project
 Project that aims at creating one Motor Task, one Cognitive Task and merge them into a Dual-Task to study Cognitive-Motor Interference

 To utilize the hand-tracking, data is transfered from Python CV ([MediaPipe](https://google.github.io/mediapipe/solutions/hands)) to Unity3D via UDP communication

##System Prerequisites
Use the package manager [pip] (https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install both OpenCV and MediaPipe

```bash
pip install opencv-python
pip install mediapipe
```

##Run
Create an executable with the Unity3D scene and Python script to run the project application
